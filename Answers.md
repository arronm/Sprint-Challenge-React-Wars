1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is an interactive ui library. Facebook created it to solve a problem of managing data in user interfaces at scale. It uses state and props to keep data in-sync and make it much faster to create reactive and meaningful UI.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

I've not heard of this as thinking in react until Lambda, but it means to think in components. I think this applies to everything in development where abstraction and re-usability are involved--even simple HTML box model should be reasoned about in this way.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A Stateful component is one that has data associated with it that it needs to manage, e.g. a form component. A Stateless component is one that only receives props and displays a UI element from those props, e.g. a post title.

1.  Describe state.

State is the data that your application has to manage, has a modal been opened, what is the email of this user, what data are we displaying to the page.

1.  Describe props.

Props can pass data down to components so it can be displayed to the UI.
